Creole spice blend
•	3 tablespoons dried oregano
•	3 tablespoons ground black pepper
•	2 tablespoons dried basil
•	2 tablespoons kosher salt
•	1 tablespoons cayenne pepper
•	1 tablespoon granulated onion
•	4 teaspoons dried thyme
•	4 teaspoons granulated garlic

Shepherd’s Pie Ingredients 
•	3 medium size sweet potatoes
•	450ml lean ground beef
•	1 onion chopped 
•	284ml beef stock
•	1 tbsp tomato paste
•	200-250 mL Corn (personal preference)
•	200-250 mL Peas (personal preference)
•	A splash of milk
•	1 tbsp butter
•	50g cheese grated (I used cheddar and parmesan, again personal preference)
•	Creole spice to taste (I used 3 tbsp)

Steps;
1.	Wrap each sweet potato individually with parchment paper.
2.	Put the sweet potatoes in the microwave on high for four minutes plus one minute for each extra potato. If potatoes are still firm heat in additional one-minute increments until desired squishiness is achieved.
3.	Cook ground beef and onion together in a pan until onion is golden and the ground beef is no longer pink.
4.	Add creole spice mix (3 tbsp used), stock, and tomato paste and stir well. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until meat is very tender. Add vegetables at 10-minute mark.
5.	Cut each potato and a half and scoop the flesh out leaving a thin layer inside each potato skin. Add butter and milk to scooped potato and mash until smooth and creamy.
6.	Preheat top element in oven at some high temperature to be determined by someone else who has experience with cooking (broil). Place the potato skins skin side down in a shallow roasting pan and spoon in the meat mixture. Top with the mash and sprinkle with cheese. Grill until cheese is melted and filling is hot then remove and serve about 5-7 minutes.
